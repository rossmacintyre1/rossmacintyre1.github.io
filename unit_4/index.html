			<h2>About</h2>
			<h3>Leaving the jargon at the office</h3>
			<p>With 7 years experience at a FMCG pan-european branding agency, and 3 of those as Head of Digital, I am excellently placed to support businesses with digital services. It’s about understanding the opportunity or challenge at hand, stepping into the customer’s shoes, and identifying how to connect and engage with them? I leave the jargon at the office and communicate very clearly to ensure there’s understanding, alignment, and above all, a passion to drive success. There’s no fluff and I’m very personable; see me in action at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwJt2CD-b2U">TEDx</a></p>

			<h2>Our World</h2>
			<h3>We're increasingly digital</h3>
			<p>I’m deeply fascinated in how the on and offline environments have irreversibly collapsed into one, and technology is increasingly integrating into our everyday lives. Users interchangeably move from the real to the virtual world without hesitation, seamlessly. Companies are recognising this, however it is simply the pace at which people are shifting their behaviours and attitudes that are resulting in companies being left behind. New devices, software updates, another social media platform, it is a constant macro demand to provide more convenience, speed and control, and users will gravitate towards the brands that deliver in these areas. It's time to keep up with change.</p>

			<h2>Experience</h2>
			<section>
				<h3>FMCG</h3>
				<p>Understanding the user behaviour, and their triggers and barriers to conversion, opens opportunities to thrive in a highly fragmented world. Refining my digital strategy and shopper marketing skills for global companies including P&G, Reckitt Benckiser, United Biscuits and Dr.Oetker, I have expertise in digital services that provides the presence that companies and brands require.</p>

				<h3>Start ups</h3>
				<p>There is nothing more rewarding than supporting a start up to market. It’s fast, energetic and uncovers builds and learnings that changes marketing activities instantly. Supporting companies such as the fancy dress supplier, Morphsuits, from just an idea to a million pound enterprise, illustrates the agility and flexibility required for business acceleration.</p>

			<section>
				<h3>Agency</h3>
				<p>The demands are constant and the rewards are fulfilling. Thriving in an environment where combining speed, competence and expertise is the surefire way in helping clients achieve their goals. With 7 years agency experience, of which 3 years were heading the digital department, I know what it takes to deliver strategy, team management and project delivery.</p>
